# Wave Function Collapse Prototype
## For Everyone
Start with smaller numbers for board sizes.
All rules are in rules.json and should be deducable how to alter them.
## For Admissions Officers

This project was submitted by for the project sections of the AP Computer Science Principle exam.
The project is in its original state with the exception with some tweaked generation rules for some better results and a slight bug fix for better usability.  
The tuning is still off (rivers galore now after trying to fix akward and too few rivers), but this is more to serve as a proof of concept that any production grade ruleset.
The original video included in the exam submission is in this repository;
there is no available executable file as the program was written in Python.  
If running the program for yourself is desired,
you may use Python to run it if you feel comfortable or grab your
favorite computer science major to help you.
